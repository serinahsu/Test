I've been currently translating international news for a NGO called *TWYCC*, 
who focusing on wacthing and planning actions for climate change in Taiwan.
I am touched what they have done by these youths and would like to share the information for them.

Although TW are not officially recognized as a party of the COP, instead TW is as observers for the time being.
TWYCC strives to gather alliance with young people at Conference of Youth (COY) and 
keep connection to Youth Non-Governmental Organizations(YOUNGO).
They keep participating Conference of the parties(COP) and bring back the content of talks 
and progress of draft of Paris Agreement Guide Book.

COP 23 is been held at Bonn, Germany. 
TWYCC decides to share the voice of Taiwan to the world.
Taiwan is a vulnerable island suffer from climate change and owns as a 1st and 6th emission of carbon of power plant at the same time . 
TWYCC expects to help govenment and industry sector to reduse the emission of carbon and green house gas.
